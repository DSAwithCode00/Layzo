        <p>
          I'm a final year BCA student at <span className="text-whiteText font-medium">MIT (Mysore Institute of Technology)</span>, with a deep passion for web development and building visually appealing, user-centric digital experiences.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4">
          I enjoy turning complex problems into clean, intuitive solutions. From developing interactive frontends to experimenting with new frameworks and tools, Iâ€™m always curious and eager to improve.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4">
          Over the past few months, Iâ€™ve worked on several personal projects using technologies like <span className="text-whiteText">HTML</span>, <span className="text-whiteText">CSS</span>, <span className="text-whiteText">JavaScript</span>, <span className="text-whiteText">React</span>, and <span className="text-whiteText">Tailwind CSS</span>. I love the process of learning by building.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4">
          Outside of coding, Iâ€™m interested in UI/UX trends, exploring productivity tools, and continuously evolving as a developer.
